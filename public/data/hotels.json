Om det inte räcker för att få dig i semesterläge, kan du ta en sväng upp till takbaren, där du kan skåla för livet med panoramautsikt över både staden och kusten. Med en cocktail i handen, förstås.",
    "När du inte kopplar av på stranden eller sippar drinkar, är Coastal Haven ett stenkast från några av Lissabons bästa sevärdheter. Utforska stadens charmiga gränder, hoppa på en båt för en dagstur på havet, eller släpp loss på en beachvolleybollmatch för att bränna av några extra kalorier (så du kan unna dig en extra cocktail senare!).",
    "Coastal Haven handlar om att njuta av det bästa från två världar: stadens energi och havets ro. Och med toppklassiga bekvämligheter som spa, gym och gratis Wi-Fi, kan du vara säker på att din vistelse kommer att vara så bekväm som den är oförglömlig."
